This is a prototype for an erp software.

taking concepts from zoho books - an online cum offline accounting software that translates buiseness
events into financial data.

We're gonna think about building this prototype in 4 steps:

1. Organization - who does the data belong to
2. Parties | Customers
3. Transactions - sale and purchases invoices
4. Dashboard - Summing it all up to generate some number that make sense.

When someone logs in, they "MUST" feel like they entered their private workspace, not like they logged in to
facebook.

Models we ll use -

1. Organization - even if our UI doesn't show it, but this is the entity who owns the space and data.
2. Customer - Someones who owes or pays money to us as a buisenss.
3. Invoice - a promise of money, a transaction bw an org and it's customers, something that can later generate
   online payment links, upi handles etc etc.
4. Dashboard summary - total invoices, total revenue generated -- always calculated
